### Release Notes:

 * New syntax: Use any shape as a target image and text box as an input action. You can specify the user input action in a separate text box and the target images using any shape, so there is no need to memorize the meaning of each shape. This makes sikuli-slides more easy and customizable so users can customize the meaning of each shape.
 * Add multiple targets per slide support but with one input action per slide. For example, you can perform left click action on multiple targets in one slide.
 * Set the order of performing input actions. If you have multiple targets on the screen, you can specify the order in which the action is executed by inserting the numeric order into the shape.
 * Sound support: Play sound while running your visual automation. This allows you to add more informative and interactive experience for your automation as well as to test voice recognition applications.
 * Text annotation: Display an overlay text on the screen. This can be an effective way to display informative text on the screen.
 * Add new visual testing operations that can be used to know whether something is visible on the screen or not.
 * Exist: check whether the target image is visible on the screen.
 * Not Exist: check whether the target image is invisible on the screen.
